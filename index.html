    <h3><span>Title: </span>Digital Outpass System</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>To develop an android application coupled with RFID for out-pass system in MIT Hostels.
 	The main idea is to digitize the out-pass system that was maintained in books. This application is developed to reduce 
	the processing time as well as the amount of paper used. Moreover, in order to assure security, the system is coupled with 
	RFID number in the student's ID card which is unique for each and every student.

    <h3><span>Title: </span>An Automated Model Based Lung Segmentation Approach to Detect Pulmonary Disorders from CT 
	Images</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>It is an Automated Model based segmentation algorithm to segment the lung from CT
	 Scan images and to diagnose pulmonary disorder in lungs using the features that are obtained from the segmented lesions. 
	In which landmark points are selected and optimized from the boundary of the lungs and three models are constructed 
	using the landmark points based on the area of the lungs. This generated models are then fitted to the lungs which gives 
	the segmented lung output.
